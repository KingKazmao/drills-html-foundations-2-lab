            my dog bothers me when i work and it makes me kinda angry cause i cant be mad at her cause shes old. 
            but sometimes i dont feel bad cause she just likes me for my food. but sometimes i sneak her a little 
            snack, cause she deserves it for being my best friend. Me and this dog will live a great long life. 
            thank you for coming to my ted talk about my dog.
